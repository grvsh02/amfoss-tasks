## My views 

My expirence with the amfosss tasks was pretty good. I had a preknowledge about some programming languages like python C/C++ and html. Doing this tasks not only i learn a bunch of new things, but I also explored a variety of new interests. After doing the tasks I got to know alot about mobile development and myself started leanring kotlin. There are instances when a particular task took me over 2-3 days and the output was still zero, but I never gave up on it. I rather started solving some other tasks and came back to it after a few hours and some more reasearch.

Programming has always kept me engaged in the process of learning and exploring new things. Solving these tasks inspired me to dive deep into coding and programming stuff, learn new tech and build stuff.

## About Myself

I'm Gaurav Sharma from Noida Uttar Pradesh. I got to know about amFOSS in the induction program and from that time I wanted to be a part of this club. I like programming alot. Building algos and creating new stuff fascinates me. I previously knew C/C++ and python and some basic html. Now I have started learning new languages like Kotlin and js. 

## Hope you like my work
