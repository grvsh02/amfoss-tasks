This task was also easy as I was already familiar with terminal commands. Below are the commands used:


~~~
cd Desktop
mkdir Coordinates-Location
~~~

For North Coordinate : 

~~~
cd Coordinates-Location
> NDegree.txt
echo "9Â°" > NDegree.txt
> NMinutes.txt
echo "5'" > NMinutes.txt
> NSeconds.txt
echo "38.1''" > NSeconds.txt
cat NDegree.txt NMinutes.txt NSeconds.txt > NorthCoordinate.txt
mv NorthCoordinate.txt North.txt
~~~

For East Coordinate :

~~~
cd Coordinates-Location
> EDegree.txt
echo "76Â°" > EDegree.txt
> EMinutes.txt
echo "29'" > EMinutes.txt
> ESeconds.txt
echo "30.8''" > ESeconds.txt
cat EDegree.txt EMinutes.txt ESeconds.txt > EastCoordinate.txt
mv EastCoordinate.txt East.txt
~~~

Collecting all the coordinates :

~~~
cd Coordinates-Location
cat ./North/North.txt ./East/East.txt > Location-Coordinate.txt
~~~

The coordinates are as follows :

9Â° 5' 38.1'' N 76Â° 29' 30.8'' E

On Map the location is actually Amritapuri campus itself ðŸ˜„
