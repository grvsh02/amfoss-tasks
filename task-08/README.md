This task was interesting as I got to know many new things. I was familiar with html and css, but javascript was all new to me. 

I have tried to make some modifications above the requirment of the task. Those are as follows:

- The Button 2 of page 2 has some extra functionality. It cycles through 5 background gradients implemented using js.

- Button 1 of page 2 ones up a overlay through which the user can input a value through the UI in the local storage. The same UI shows the value stored in the local storage in the last session.

- Button 3 of page 2 shows the current time in a overlay implemented through css and js.

- The page 3 is implemented using Chart.js library and therefore include a few mods applied to beautify the graph.

Hope you like my work
